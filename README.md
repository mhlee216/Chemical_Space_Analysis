# Chemical_Space_Analysis

- Chemical space comparison of two different datasets
- Visualization according to physicochemical properties
- Scaffold Analysis


#### Discussion

1. The two datasets can be clearly distinguished from the results using MACCS Fingerprint and PCA.
2. It is difficult to verify the cluster relationship between the scaffolds and the original compounds.
