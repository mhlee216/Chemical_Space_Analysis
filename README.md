# Chemical_Space_Analysis

#### Purpose

- Chemical space comparison of two different datasets
- Visualization according to physicochemical properties
- Scaffold Analysis
- Analysis of intersecting molecules in different data sets with similar chemical spaces



#### Case Study

- Case 1 (Chemical_Space_Analysis_Aspirin_Imatinib.ipynb)

: Chemical space comparison of different data sets: Aspirin-Like Molecules & Imatinib-Like Molecules

- Case 2 (Chemical_Space_Analysis_Aspirin_Ibuprofen.ipynb)

: Chemical space comparison of similar data sets: Aspirin-Like Molecules & Ibuprofen-Like Molecules



#### Discussion

1. In Case 1, the two datasets can be clearly distinguished from the results using MACCS fingerprint and PCA.
2. In Case 1, it is difficult to verify the cluster relationship between the scaffolds and the original compounds.
3. In Case 2, scaffolds in two similar data sets have junctions.
4. In Case 2, although they are different data sets, they share a common scaffold, and sampling it will allow us to penetrate between the two chemical spaces.
5. For drug repositioning, it will be possible to analyze the chemical space of known and approved drugs and the chemical space of molecules similar to ligands of the target protein.
6. Similarity calculations can be used.
